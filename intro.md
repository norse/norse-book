# Introduction

The last few years have seen tremendous progress in the application of Deep Neural networks to a wide range of tasks, from computer vision, to playing games and attacking major open scientific problems like protein-folding. In the domain of computational neuroscience and brain-inspired
computing gradient based techniques have already helped to map a new path aswell. The purpose
of this book is to both illuminate possible further developments and demonstrate them using
executable code.
